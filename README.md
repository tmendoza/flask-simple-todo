# flask-simple-todo
A very simple todo list manager using Flask as a front-end to a MongoDB backend

# Purpose
This fairly simple Flask application is meant as a fairly straightforward REST API implementation of a Tod List manager.  This todo list manager will be deployed as a locally executing REST API application acting as a API backend for an Autogen Python API services.

the end goal is to have a ChatGPT like interface on top of a todo list manager.  Ideally, it will be the backend for a platform such as Autogen.
